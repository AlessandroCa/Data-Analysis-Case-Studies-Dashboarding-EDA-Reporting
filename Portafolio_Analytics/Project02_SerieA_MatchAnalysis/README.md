## Serie A Match Analysis (2008–2009) – Python Data Processing & Performance Metrics

This repository contains a structured analysis of match results from the Italian Serie A 2008–2009 season, based on a preloaded Python dataset representing real match outcomes.

The data is stored as a collection of tuples including match date, home team, away team, and goals scored. Through a set of custom Python functions, the dataset is processed to extract team-level performance indicators and season-wide rankings.

The analysis includes:
- Calculation of total points earned by a selected team according to official league rules.
- Generation of performance summaries, reporting wins, draws, and losses.
- Construction of a dictionary-based leaderboard mapping each team to its final season points.

The focus of this work is on algorithmic reasoning, dictionary-based aggregation, and clear data transformation logic, demonstrating how raw structured data can be converted into meaningful analytical outputs using Python.
