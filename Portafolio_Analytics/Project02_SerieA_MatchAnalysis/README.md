# Serie A Match Analysis 2008–2009 – Python Data Processing & Performance Evaluation

This project focuses on analyzing match results from the Italian Serie A 2008–2009 football season using a preloaded Python data structure.
The dataset, composed of tuples containing match dates, home and away teams, and respective goals, is used to calculate and display team performance metrics through a series of custom-built functions.

The program performs the following analytical tasks:

- Computes the total number of points earned by a given team based on wins, draws, and losses.

- Returns a performance summary for any team, including total wins, draws, and defeats.

- Generates a dictionary-based leaderboard, mapping each team to its final total points across the entire season.

This project demonstrates skills in data manipulation, algorithmic logic, dictionary structures, and user-interactive Python scripting, applied to a real-world sports dataset.
