This project analyzes mobile phone call records to compute customer billing and identify network congestion areas.

Starting from a raw CSV file containing call logs, the project performs data validation, data cleaning, time-based calculations, and aggregation to:
- compute call durations,
- calculate monthly bills with free-minute bonuses,
- detect congested network cells based on call volume.

The focus is on transforming raw, potentially inconsistent data into reliable metrics using Python data structures and analytical logic.
