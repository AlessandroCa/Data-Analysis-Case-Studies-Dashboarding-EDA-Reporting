Project Title

BiblioSoftware – Integrated Library Management Solution

Project Description

BiblioSoftware is an integrated software solution designed to streamline and digitalize the management of library resources.
The system enables continuous user interaction through a dynamic command-line interface, allowing efficient execution of key operations such as adding, searching, updating, and removing books from the library database.
A persistent loop ensures seamless navigation between functionalities until the user explicitly terminates the session by entering the command "exit".

Developed with a focus on usability, modularity, and data integrity, the project demonstrates core principles of software design, control flow management, and user-driven system interaction.
